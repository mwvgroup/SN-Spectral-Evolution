Introduction
============

Following the discovery of the accelerating expansion of the universe
(Riess et al.1998; Perlmutter et al. 1999), the field of supernova cosmology
has continuously leveraged spectrophotometric surveys to probe cosmological
properties out to an ever increasing redshift. At it's core
this application of type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) as cosmological probes relies
on the assertion that they are standardizable to a uniform luminosity.
Unfortunately, as the number of available SN surveys grow, so too do indications
that SNe Ia may undergo luminosity evolution as a population.

Over the past decade there has been a growing agreement in the literature
that standardized SNe Ia luminosities at peak brightness correlate with
various host galaxy properties (Gallagher et al. 2008; Kelly et al. 2010;
Sullivan et al.2010; Lampeitl et al. 2010; Gupta et al. 2011;
Rigaultet al. 2013; Jones et al. 2015; Moreno-Raya et al. 2016;
Uddin et al. 2017; Kim et al. 2018; Rigault et al. 2018;Jones et al. 2018;
Rose et al. 2019). Recent work has also explored the potential for
luminosity evolution as a function of spectroscopic redshift
(Kang et al. 2020; Rose et al. 2020; Blondin et al.2018).
Fortunately, modern cosmological surveys have been able
to incorporate these correlations in the standardization process
and minimize distance biases to the sub percent level (cite?). However,
further investigate into these trends is warranted given the lack of
a theoretical explanation.

Multiple spectroscopic properties have been considered in the literature
to probe for systematic physical differences in SNe polpulation.
For example, the presence and depth of absorption features provides
an indication of various ion abundances produced in the explosion.
The velocity of these features also provides information about the ions'
distribution within the photosphere and the kinetic energy of the SN event.
This latter effect is particularly important from a cosmological perspective
as the kinetic energy of the ejecta directly impacts it's opacity. As a result,
SNe with higher ejecta velocities tend to be both brighter and have broader
light-curve shapes.

We here investigate the existence of potential biases in spectroscopic
observables using a set of ?? spectroscopically observed SNe Ia compiled from
the literature and .
