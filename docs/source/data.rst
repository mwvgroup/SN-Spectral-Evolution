Some quotes from various data releases we consider

`Folatelli et al. 2013`_
------------------------

CSP DR1 includes 604 spectra of 93 SNe Ia. The observations cover a range of
phases from 12 days before to over 150 days after the time of B-band maximum light.

`Sako et al. 2018`_
-------------------

Sako et al. 2018 presents data from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey-II (SDSS-II)
Supernova Survey conducted between 2005 and 2007. Light curves are presented
for 10,258 variable and transient sources discovered through repeat `ugriz`
imaging of SDSS Stripe 82, a 300 deg2 area along the celestial equator. This
data release is comprised of all transient sources brighter than r â‰ƒ 22.5 mag
with no history of variability prior to 2004.
