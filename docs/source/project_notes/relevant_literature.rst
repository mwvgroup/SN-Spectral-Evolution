Relevant Literature
===================

Multiple spectroscopic properties have been considered in the literature
to probe for systematic physical differences in low and high redshift SNe.
For example, the presence and depth of absorption features provides
an indication of various ion produced in the explosion.
The velocity of these features also provides information about the ions'
distribution within the photosphere and the kinetic energy of the SN event.
This latter effect is particularly important from a cosmological perspective
as the kinetic energy of the ejecta  directly impacts it's opacity. As a result,
SNe with higher ejecta velocities tend to be both brighter and have broader
light-curve shapes.

In Hook+ 2005 14 high-redshift (0.17 < z < 0.83) SNe were considered from
the SupernovaCosmology Project and no evidence was found for evolution in
SNe Ia properties with redshift. Plotting the high-redshift sample against
well-observed local SNe showed a clear indication that the overall trends
spectroscopic evolution are the same at low and high z. Furthermore,
measurements of the Ca ejecta velocity in the high-redshift spectra were
also consistent with those measured from low-redshift, Branch-normal SNe Ia.
