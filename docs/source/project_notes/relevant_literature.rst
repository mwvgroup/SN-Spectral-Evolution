Relevant Literature
===================

Multiple spectroscopic properties have been considered in the literature
to probe for systematic physical differences in low and high redshift SNe.
For example, the presence and depth of absorption features provides
an indication of various ion produced in the explosion.
The velocity of these features also provides information about the ions'
distribution within the photosphere and the kinetic energy of the SN event.
This latter effect is particularly important from a cosmological perspective
as the kinetic energy of the ejecta directly impacts it's opacity. As a result,
SNe with higher ejecta velocities tend to be both brighter and have broader
light-curve shapes.

`Blondin 2012`_

Considered 2603 spectra of 462 SNe Ia observed by the Center for Astrophysics
(CfA) supernova program from October 1993 through August 2008. Out of the
observed targets, 313 have two or more spectra, and of these each SN has an
average of 8 observed spectra.

Conclusions
^^^^^^^^^^^

Using the classification schemes of Branch 2006 Wang 2009 there was found to
be a continuum of spectroscopic properties (i.e., no strict boundaries)
between the different subclasses that was unlikely to be explained by a single
parameter.

In Branch 2009 it was proposed that SNe Ia from the Core Normal subclass
1) have a significantly smaller scatter in intrinsic peak brightness, and 2)
decline photometrically at the same rate as the Shallow Silicon (SS) subclass.
The first claim is rejected and the second is shown not to be universally true.
It was also found that SS, CN, and Broad Line (BL) SNe form a sequence of
increasingly steep width-luminosity relations. The same is true for the

Using early-time spectra to probe the outermost ejecta, Silicon is shown to
absorb at velocities that are larger than expected for a pure deflagration
model.

In Mazzali 1998 the correlation of Δm15(B) and the FWHM of the iron emission
feature at ∼4700 Å was interpreted as a correlation between luminosity and
explosion kinetic energy. This paper finds that the correlation is largely
driven by SN 1991bg-like SNe and that by excluding low luminosity SNe
(Δm15(B) < 1.6 mag), there is no correlation between both quantities (r=−0.17)

`Hook 2005`_
------------

In Hook+ 2005 14 high-redshift (0.17 < z < 0.83) SNe were considered from
the SupernovaCosmology Project and no evidence was found for evolution in
SNe Ia properties with redshift. Plotting the high-redshift sample against
well-observed local SNe showed a clear indication that the overall trends
spectroscopic evolution are the same at low and high z. Furthermore,
measurements of the Ca ejecta velocity in the high-redshift spectra were
also consistent with those measured from low-redshift, Branch-normal SNe Ia.
