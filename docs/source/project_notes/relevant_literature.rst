.. note:: **TLDR:** SNe Ia are subclassed into shallow silicon, core-normal,
   broad line, and cool groups based on relative the strength of Si II
   features at 5750 and 6100 Angstroms.

This paper identifies classifications of SNe Ia using the width of the 5750
and 6100 features (usually attributed to Si ii at 5972 and 6355). To simplify
the process of feature comparison, spectra are first tilted by multiplying
the flux by :math:`\lambda^\alpha` where :math:`\alpha` is chosen such that
the peak flux near 4600 and 6300 A are equal. The Equivalent widths are then
plotted for the feature at 5750 A vs the feature at 6100 A. After applying a
nearest neighbor algorithm, four groups emerged: shallow silicon, core-normal,
broad line, and cool (which includes SN 1991bg).

Broad-line SNe Ia have absorption features at 6100 A absorptions that are
broader and deeper than core-normal SNe Ia. However, SNe in this category do
not appear to follow a simple one-dimensional sequence based on their distance
from the core-normal population.

The shallow silicon group are not (necessarily) very different from the core
normal group. Other than a narrower Si feature, they look remarkably similar.
The primary reason for the spectroscopic differences seems to be the lower
temperature, as indicated by low temperature ion signatures (e.g. Ti).
Otherwise, they have the same ions evident in their spectra, just at very
different optical depths. This aligns with their lower temperatures since
*"as noted by Hatano+ (2002) and Ho Flich+ (2002), there is a
temperature threshold below which, owing to abrupt changes in key ionization
ratios, line optical depths change abruptly (Hatano+ 1999)."*

The core-normal subgroup have a very high degree of similarity, suggesting
a standard, common physical mechanism involving no large inhomogeneities near
the characteristic photosphere velocity of 12,000 km/s.

- **Redshift:** 0.17 < z < 0.83

**Conclusions:**

No evidence was found for evolution in SNe Ia properties with redshift.
Plotting the high-redshift sample against well-observed local SNe showed a
clear indication that the overall trends spectroscopic evolution are the
same at low and high z. Furthermore, measurements of the Ca ejecta velocity
in the high-redshift spectra were also consistent with those measured from
low-redshift, Branch-normal SNe Ia.

**Conclusions:**

No evidence was found of SNe Ia evolution with redshift. Measured pseudo-equivalent widths for a group of high and low redshift SNe and plotted feature strength with respect to redshift for MgII, SiII, and CaII, as well as CaII ejection velocity. The core normal SNe showed no consistent trend. They did observe a correlation between the strength of the SiII feature and the peak magnitude. However, this trend did not significantly improve standardization over stretch parameter corrections.

**Conclusions:**

Using the classification schemes of Branch 2006 Wang 2009 there was found to
be a continuum of spectroscopic properties (i.e., no strict boundaries)
between the different subclasses that was unlikely to be explained by a single
parameter.

In Branch 2009 it was proposed that SNe Ia from the Core Normal subclass
1) have a significantly smaller scatter in intrinsic peak brightness, and 2)
decline photometrically at the same rate as the Shallow Silicon (SS) subclass.
The first claim is rejected and the second is shown not to be universally true.
It was also found that SS, CN, and Broad Line (BL) SNe form a sequence of
increasingly steep width-luminosity relations. The same is true for the
91T, Normal, High-velocity sequence used in the Wang 2009 classification
scheme

Using early-time spectra to probe the outermost ejecta, Silicon is shown to
absorb at velocities that are larger than expected for a pure deflagration
model.

In Mazzali 1998 the correlation of Δm15(B) and the FWHM of the iron emission
feature at ∼4700 Å was interpreted as a correlation between luminosity and
explosion kinetic energy. This paper finds that the correlation is largely
driven by SN 1991bg-like SNe and that by excluding low luminosity SNe
(Δm15(B) < 1.6 mag), there is no correlation between both quantities (r=−0.17)
