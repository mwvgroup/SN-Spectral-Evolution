		Late time spectrum. 
2005am 7.59
		Skip pW1
	11.56
		put end slightly outside of bounds for pW2
		Take right peak for end of Pw4
		skip 5 and 6 (late time spectrum)
2005bl -6.820
		Feature 4- we didn't take the rightmost peak because it wasn't included in 5 bounds, tried to extend 		the right bound as far as possible still
		Ignore plateau between 5 and 6
		Started 6 on higher left shoulder
		pW7

	-2.820
		Small dip between 3 and 4 ignored
		Took rightmost peak for 4
		Ignoring the dip between 5 and 6
		Took middle of little 6/7 plateau
		Extended 7 as far as possible before it started going back down
2005el
	-7.440
		Taking little plateau in the middle between 2 and 3
		Ignoring the 3/4 dip
		Taking the right peak of feature 4
		Ignoring the dip and plateau between 5 and 6
		Making the blue 6 bound farther to the right to ignore the plateau
		Taking the 7 tail
	-6.420
		Skipping 1
		middle of tiny 2/3 plateau
		ignore small 3/4 dip
		take rightmost peak for 4
		from now on, include the 5/6 dip in 5 but ignore the plateau
		middle of tiny 6/7 plateau, still butt up
		take 7 as far right as possible before it starts to go down at all
	1.620
		skip 1
		middle of tiny 2/3 plateau
		exclude 3/4 dip
		right peak of 4
		take blue 6 bound farther right to ignore 5/6 plateau
		
	14.580	*late time
		skip 1
		measuring 3 to be giant because 2 goes away in the late time
		skip 5 and 6 because they combine in late time
	14.590  * late time
		only measured 3 and 8
	14.600  *late time
		2 disappears, 3 becomes giant
		skip 4 because it's cut off
		
2005eq
	-7.030
		skip 1
		take tiny 2/3 plateau
		ignore 3/4 plateau
		take right 4 peak
		take middle of right 4 peak so 4 and 5 butt up
		including 5/6 dip in 5 but ignoring plateau
	5.890
		ignore 3/4 dip
		end 4 exactly at the end of the second dip
		end of 7 as far right before it starts to go down
		
	5.900
		6 is cut off so ignore
	5.920
		include little dip in between 1 and 2 as a part of 2
		exclude 3/4 dip
2005hc
	-5.320
		take right peak for 4
		ignoring boundary for the left side of 5 so 4 and 5 butt up
	-5.310
		skipped -disgusting
	-1.17
		skip 1
		ignore 3/4 dip
		take right peak for 4
		including the 5/6 dip in 5 but ignoring the plateau
	.750
		skip 1
		ignore 3/4 dip
		right peak
		extend 6 farther right
2005iq
	10.87
		skip 1
		ignore 2 because 3 gets giant in late time
		late phase but 5 and 6 still seem distinguishable so we measured
2005kc
	.470
		first 3 features don't match the boundaries at all so we didn't measure them
		including 5/6 dip as part of 5 but excluding the plateau
	1.480	
		skipping 1 and 2 because bounds are wrong
		ignoring left bound with 3 because the bounds seem wrong
		ignoring 3/4 dip
		include 5/6 dip as part of 5, excluding plateau
	14.420 *late time
		skip 1
		2 included as a part of 3
		skip 5/6
2005ke
	-1.320
		**looks really weird not sure if it's a different type
		skip 1
		ignore 6/7 dip
	-0.320
		skip 1
		for this one and the last one the rightmost peak for 4 isn't included in 5's bounds so can't ignore 		it in 5
		ignore 6/7 dip
	0.570
		skip 2 because it doesn't seem to exist
