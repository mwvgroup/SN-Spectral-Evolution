Spectra to look out for:

2005al late-time spectrum (1-3 months)

2005hc  (pW5 in 2005hc would end at 5300AA, which is outside of the feature boundary. )

2006bh (features 2 and 3) 

2006hx pW5 

2005A 

2006mr possibly a late time spectrum? 

2007N

2007le many of the features are obvious but fall out of the ranges of the boundaries. 

2008gp line running through it. And break from 6216-6343

2008ia possibly late time spectrum. Features 1-3â€™s boundaries are off. 

2009ab line through it and break in spectrum through 6350-6480.

2009ad line through it and break in spectrum from 6240-6375.

NOTE: tiny dip between pW4 and pW5 has not been included in either feature in Emily's measurements.
