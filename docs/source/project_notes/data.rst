Data
====

This project considers data from multiple data releases. Brief descriptions
of each data set are provided here.

CPS DR1 (`Folatelli et al. 2013`_)
----------------------------------

The first Carnegie Supernova Project (CSP) was a five-year survey run at
Las Campanas Observatory (LCO) from 2004 through 2009 using the Swope 1 m
and du-Pont 2.5 m telescopes. The first CSP data release (CSP DR1) includes
604 spectra of 93 SNe Ia. Observations cover phases ranging from -12 to
over 150 days as measured from the estimated time of B-band maximum light and
a redshift range of :math:`.005 < z < 0.085`. Since RA and Dec coordinates were
missing from the publicly available CSP DR1 data files, coordinate values were
used from the third public data release (DR3).

SDSS (`Sako et al. 2018`_)
--------------------------

The Sloan Digital Sky Survey-II (SDSS-II) Supernova Survey was conducted
between 2005 and 2007. The spectroscopic portion of the SDSS SN data release
includes 1359 transient and variable objects, 692 of which were classified as
being SNe Ia. Redshift values for the SDSS data sample run from
:math:`.014 < z < 0.580`.

A number of SDSS spectra have visible Ha features that indicated an incomplete
host galaxy subtraction. Furthermore, some spectra are too noisy to confidently
identify the location or presence of various features. These spectra are
identified by visual inspection, and are skipped at the discretion of the
investigator.
