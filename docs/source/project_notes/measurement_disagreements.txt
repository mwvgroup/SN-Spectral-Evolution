Main Takeaways: 
	- Make pW1 as wide as possible without overlapping pW2.
	- If the end of pW4 falls on a shoulder, take the redder/rightmost peak as the end 	  boundary. 
	- Don't include the plateau between pW5 and pW6 in measurements for either feature
	  unless it is very small. 
	- pW6 and pW7 are supposed to touch, so use the beginning of pW7 to help determine
	  the end of pW6, if ambiguous. 
	- If a tiny plateau exists between two features, take the center of it.
