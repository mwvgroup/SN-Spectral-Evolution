# Evolution of SNe Metallicities with Redshift

A comparison of galactic and supernova metallicity measurements as a function of redshift.

## Initial Questions:

-  How do the metallicity relationships compare?
- Do we see different trends if we break SNe down by subtype
- Do we see any trends in the strengths of various features
